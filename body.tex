\section{Introduction}
In order to sucessfully comission the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and begin the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) we need to be able to perform astrometric and photometric calibrations of individual visits. 
This calibration will be done in the rubin science pipelines by comparing instrumental fluxes of stars to a reference catalog.
To meet the science requirements for relative photometric precision (OSS-REQ-0387) the rms of repeated measurements of unresloved sources must be, at a miniumum, less than 8 mmag (12 mmag) for gri-band (uzy-band) observations. 
Additionally, the requirements for the astrometric quality of data are defined in OSS-REQ-038 are such that the rms on the distance between pairs of sources must be less than 10 milli-arcseconds, with an error on the accuracy of less than 50 mas in any axis.
