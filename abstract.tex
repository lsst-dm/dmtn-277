In order to facilitate bootstrap photometric calibrations of early Rubin Observatory data we have created an all sky reference catalog called \monster. 
This reference catalog uses a ranked order set of other reference catalogs to generate synthetic \textit{ugrizy}-band fluxes that can be used calibrate images processed with the LSST science pipelines. 
This document describes the methodology used to create \monster, documents the input external reference catalogs, and performs basic data validation of the first version of \monster.
